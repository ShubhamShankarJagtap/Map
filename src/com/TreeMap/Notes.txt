TreeMap:

It is an implemented class of NavigableMap interface, but it also inherits the properties of sorted map and Map interface.

Syntax:-

 Package java.util;
class TreeMap implements NavigableMap, SortedMap, Map

It was introduced in jdk version 1.2

The underline data structure of the treeMap is "Red-Black Tree."

Properties of Red-Black Tree.

           1] Every node is either "RED" or "BACK."

           2] The root node is always "BLACK."

           3] Every leaf node(null node) is "BLACK."

           4] If a node is red then, both of its children are "BLACK."

           5] For each node, all paths from node to its descendant leaf nodes contain the same number of "BLACK" nodes.


Properties of TreeMap:

          1] Data stored in the treeMap is in the form of "key-value" pair.

 **** 2]TreeMap follows "SORTING ORDER" with respect to 'keys.'

         3]TreeMap doesn't follow 'Insertion order.'

         4] It can store "Homogeneous" and "heterogeneous" elements.

         5] It can't store null value's.

         6] It is a non-synchronized data structure.
